Ezra was alive during this time and would have been witness to the events that unfolded in the Book of Esther. He had seen God at work.

Ezra tells us in verse five that God also prompted the spirits of those Jews who he wanted to participate in the rebuilding of the Temple. This also means that many Jews are not prompted to return (think of Esther and Mordecai). We learn in verse six that “…all those who were about them” or “their neighbors” assisted in providing silver, gold, livestock, and goods. This means that the Persians themselves help fund the venture, just as the Egyptians had given the Israelites vast material help as they left Egypt for the Promised Land. In addition, Cyrus had Mithredath, his treasurer, return all of the Temple objects that Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, who had sacked the Temple and carried away all of its artifacts, placing them in the temple of his god. He hands them to Sheshbazzar, called the prince of Judah, in verse eight. Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel are both identified as leaders of the exiled Jews and their relationship is unclear from scripture. It’s been suggested that Sheshbazzar is Zerubbabel, one man having two names, one Persian and one Hebrew, just like Esther, who was also Hadassah. Another suggestion is that Sheshbazzar was the court official the Persians held officially accountable for the return to Jerusalem and the reconstruction of the Temple, while Zerubbabel actually led and accomplished the work. Zerubbabel is named in both genealogies concerning Christ, which appear in  Matthew and Luke.",
        "paragraph3b": "After this, running to verse 70 at the end of chapter 2, we get a meticulous listing of Temple artifacts and a long listing of the people and families returning to Jerusalem. People are identified as leaders and tribal leaders, by family name and geographic place name, as priests, as Temple workers and Temple servants (Levites, singers, and gatekeepers), descendants of servants to Solomon, and then those who claimed to be either priests or descendants of Jewish families but could not prove their ancestry. Altogether, including people not explicitly mentioned, they number are about 50,000 including servants.",

        "content": "Cyrus began his rule of the greater Persian Empire in 538 B.C. He established the system of provinces and governance by satraps that we saw in Esther. Cyrus was broadminded for the time and allowed the far provinces of his empire to retain their cultural and religious identities. We see this at the beginning of Chapter 1:1-4. In contrast to the Book of Esther, Ezra is rich with references to God. We begin with a proclamation from Cyrus in verse 2 but there is more. Verse 1 shares much information about how God is working in these circumstances. Question: What do we learn? God stirred Cyrus’ spirit causing him to issue his proclamation and to put it into writing, showing us that God is not limited to those who follow him. All of creation is subject to him; and no one is beyond his influence. What is stunning is that Cyrus’ role was prophesied by Isaiah around 680 B.C., more than 140 years before Cyrus issued his edict in 538 B.C. Isaiah 44 and 45 prophesy both Christ and Cyrus. Cyrus is identified, by name, as the one who will be God’s instrument in delivering Israel from the Babylonian captivity. Beginning in Isaiah 44:24 God says, “ “I am the LORD who made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself,…who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose; saying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’ and of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.” The foretelling of Cyrus by name makes it clear to anyone reading this passage in conjunction with the Book of Ezra that God is in control of history. The Jewish historian Josephus wrote that Cyrus read the prophetic passage in Isaiah concerning him, and was eager to fulfill what God had spoken. Assuming that Ezra is the primary writer of the Book of Ezra what does he know that enables him to have this bold insight to Cyrus’ motivation? Ezra led a second group of exiles to Israel in 458 B.C. Esther and Mordecai followed God’s leading to deliver the Jews from extermination in 473 B.C., and after this Purim was celebrated every year in remembrance. Ezra was alive during this time and would have been witness to the events that unfolded in the Book of Esther. He had seen God at work. Cyrus’ proclamation itself also aligns with the prophecy in Jeremiah concerning the length of Israel’s captivity. Here is what Jeremiah 29: 10-13 says: “(10) This is what the LORD says: “When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place. (11) For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. (12) Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. (13) You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. (14) I will be found by you,” declares the LORD, “and will bring you back from captivity.[b] I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,” declares the LORD, “and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.” The length of time is calculated from the time the Babylonians first invaded Israel in 606 B.C. until the first exiles returned to Judah, in approximately 506 B.C.; this is indeed 70 years. Scholars argue over the significance and application of the 70-year span, but the fact that it applies so clearly as stated above is supernatural in its correspondence. One of the splendid narratives in the Book of Esther, which also continues in Ezra, is the use of official Persian court documents and statements. Here it is again beginning in verse 2. J. Brian Tucker notes that the language of this edict is quite close to the wording of the Elephantine papyrus, dating back to 407 B.C., which requested permission from the Persian provincial governor to rebuild a temple in the Egyptian city of Elephantine. Question: Read the proclamation. What do Cyrus and God intend to accomplish? For Cyrus it was part of a larger and brilliant political strategy to win the allegiance of all the provinces in his vast and new empire by allowing them to keep their unique cultural and religious identities. Cyrus openly recognized the Hebrew God, identifying him as “the LORD God of heaven”, a title that is used 17 times in Ezra, Nehemiah, and Daniel (Warren Wiersbe, Be Heroic). God uses Cyrus’ words and formal edict to tell us that he is at work. God calls on a substantial number of people to accomplish his purpose and he gives them a singular mission to accomplish that supersedes their individual interests and desires. Cyrus intends to create a formal record of his rulings and decrees as king, so that there can be no confusion as to his decision. God uses it to create a record of his purpose and will, that we as believers may read today as proof of his larger plan across history, and his continuing preparation for the arrival of Christ. Following this decree there is an increase and broadening of activity as preparation is made for the return to Jerusalem. Ezra tells us in verse five that God also prompted the spirits of those Jews who he wanted to participate in the rebuilding of the Temple. This also means that many Jews are not prompted to return (think of Esther and Mordecai). We learn in verse six that “…all those who were about them” or “their neighbors” assisted in providing silver, gold, livestock, and goods. This means that the Persians themselves help fund the venture, just as the Egyptians had given the Israelites vast material help as they left Egypt for the Promised Land. In addition, Cyrus had Mithredath, his treasurer, return all of the Temple objects that Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, who had sacked the Temple and carried away all of its artifacts, placing them in the temple of his god. He hands them to Sheshbazzar, called the prince of Judah, in verse eight. Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel are both identified as leaders of the exiled Jews and their relationship is unclear from scripture. It’s been suggested that Sheshbazzar is Zerubbabel, one man having two names, one Persian and one Hebrew, just like Esther, who was also Hadassah. Another suggestion is that Sheshbazzar was the court official the Persians held officially accountable for the return to Jerusalem and the reconstruction of the Temple, while Zerubbabel actually led and accomplished the work. Zerubbabel is named in both genealogies concerning Christ, which appear in Matthew and Luke. After this, running to verse 70 at the end of chapter 2, we get a meticulous listing of Temple artifacts and a long listing of the people and families returning to Jerusalem. People are identified as leaders and tribal leaders, by family name and geographic place name, as priests, as Temple workers and Temple servants (Levites, singers, and gatekeepers), descendants of servants to Solomon, and then those who claimed to be either priests or descendants of Jewish families but could not prove their ancestry. Altogether, including people not explicitly mentioned, they number are about 50,000 including servants. Question: When we encounter genealogies in scripture, they can seem pedantic and superfluous. But there are substantial reasons for their inclusion, and this is reinforced by its inclusion in Nehemiah as well. Why do God and Ezra focus on the genealogy in this narrative? The Jews had been in exile for more than two generations and away from the Promised Land. Two generations was long enough to sweep away remembrance of the Law and past practices for many Israelites. This is God’s way of intentionally reconstituting a segment of his people. It created and preserved a clear written record identifying the people who rebuilt and reestablished the Temple; so there could be no future claims that Persians or Samaritans rebuilt the temple or that any different use was intended for the Temple. It tells us that God remembers each of us individually and remembers us by name. It confirms the prophesy in Isaiah 44 and 45 that Cyrus the Great would be God’s instrument in delivering the Israelites from the Babylonian captivity and would play a role in God’s greater plan to bring Christ into the world.

The same thing can happen to us. n Isaiah 41: 1- 4 & 8-13, God spoke to Israel, spoke to the returned exiles, and speaks to us today about this very thing: ““Be silent before me, you islands! Let the nations renew their strength! Let them come forward and speak; let us meet together at the place of judgment. (2) “Who has stirred up one from the east, calling him in righteousness to his service? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword, to windblown chaff with his bow. (3) He pursues them and moves on unscathed, by a path his feet have not traveled before. (4) Who has done this and carried it through, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD—with the first of them and with the last—I am he.”...“But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you descendants of Abraham my friend, (9) I took you from the ends of the earth, from its farthest corners I called you. I said, ‘You are my servant’; I have chosen you and have not rejected you. 10 So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. (11) “All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish. (12) Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all. (13) For I am the LORD your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.”” In this passage God tells Israel that he will stir up one from the east, meaning Cyrus the Great, and promises to Israel his own divine intervention to bring about his purposes, including the vanquishing of seemingly overwhelming enemies. Knowing this the Israelites should not fear, should not be dismayed, and should remember that God is at hand to help them. We should remember this as well."

At the beginning of chapter 5 we see that the returned exiles have drifted from their original purpose in rebuilding the temple. Cyrus the Great died in 530 B.C. His son, Cambyses II, ruled from 530 B.C. until 522 B.C. Cambyses II died under disputed circumstances, and he was succeeded by Bardiya, who was either a younger son of Cyrus the Great or an impostor who was murdered shortly after assuming the throne. Darius the Great, who will rule from 522 B.C. until 486 B.C., is now the king. At the beginning of chapter 5 we read that God moved his prophets, Haggai and Zechariah to prophesy. Here is what Haggai, in Haggai, chapter 1, said. Question: In Haggai God is speaking directly to the chosen exiles he stirred and caused to return to Judah. What is his focus? ““In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest: (2) “Thus says the LORD of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD.” (3) Then the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, (4) “Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? (5) Now, therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. (6) You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes. (7) “Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. (8) Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the LORD. (9) You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. (10) Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. (11) And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.” (12) Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him. And the people feared the LORD. (13) Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke to the people with the LORD's message, “I am with you, declares the LORD.” (14) And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, (15) on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.”” God acknowledges that people, including many of the exiles, are saying that it’s not time to rebuild the temple and have used this excuse for 16 years. He convicts the exiles of using the time, labor, and materials meant for the temple to build lavish “paneled houses” for themselves, selfishly using the cedars from Lebanon to line their dwellings. God reveals the restless hearts and souls of a people who have turned to themselves and away from God. They‘ve been busy but have accomplished very little. Nothing makes them happy; not food or drink, or clothes. Their disobedience has left them cold. God has not been able to bless the returned exiles because they have been steadfast in their disobedience. God has dried up the rain that sustains the soil, and all the essential harvests have diminished. The words of Haggai and Zechariah, God’s prophets, are effective and convicting. Verse 13 tells us that the returned exiles heard, obeyed, and rekindled their respect for God. Not only does God share clear words of revelation, conviction, and instruction, and he acts affirmatively to again stir the exiles (v. 14) to resume reconstruction of the temple. Contrast this inertia and disobedience with Esther, who also faced uncertain and threatening circumstances, and resolute enemies; but chose to obey God as best she could. When she made her choice to obey, regardless of cost, God blessed her actions. Psalm 119: 129 & 130, reminds us of the powerful guidance, positive support, conviction, wisdom, and revelation that God’s word brings to our lives: ““Your testimonies are wonderful; therefore my soul keeps them. (130) The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.”” James 1:22-25 says: ““(22) But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. (23) For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. (24) For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. (25) But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.”” This is the expression of faith in response to God’s word. Psalm 51 tells us that the sacrifices that God values most are a broken spirit, and a broken and contrite heart. This is where real faith begins, in the absolute recognition that it is only through God that we have life and purpose. When we approach God this way he draws near to us. God’s word is effective.

They don’t oppose the construction in the same way Samaritan administrators did in the letter shared in chapter 4, but they want confirmation that the rebuilding of the temple has the king’s approval. Question: How is this different from challenge shared in chapter 4? The returned exiles don’t stop working. Tattenai is more inquiring than opposing. There is a reason for this. Verses 4 & 5 tell us:““(4) They[a] also asked them this: “What are the names of the men who are building this building?” (5) But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until the report should reach Darius and then an answer be returned by letter concerning it.””God’s intersession restrains Tattenai and grants the returned exiles the courage to continue. We even see God’s strong hand in the correspondence to Darius the Great; in verses 11-17. The letter that Tattenai and his administrators write is a thing of beauty. It is an official inquiry, written in Aramaic, the official administrative language of the Persian Empire; but within its text the returned Jewish exiles bear testimony to who they are, the origin of the temple, the nature of the God they worship, their history of disobedience, God’s plan, and Cyrus the Great’s role, and his acknowledgement of the very God for whom the temple is being reconstructed.

(7) And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with glory, says the LORD of hosts. (8) The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the LORD of hosts. (9) The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts. And in this place I will give peace, declares the LORD of hosts.”” As the Jews rebuild in a stark landscape God shares a far greater promise: the coming downfall of Persia to Alexander the Great, and the arrival of his own son,Christ Jesus at the temple gate to bring peace and salvation to the world. Book Of Ezra: God’s Unbroken Circle; The Rise Of Ezra. Finally, on March 12, of 516 B.C. the rebuilding of the temple was completed; approximately 70 years after Nebuchadnezzar ordered its complete destruction in 586 B.C; and 21 years after Zerubbabel and Jeshua led the exiles back to Jerusalem and first laid the temple foundation. Darius the Great, the current king of Persia has set the stage by warning off all of the provincial leaders situated in Samaria, including Tattenai, the governor, to not only stay out of the way of the rebuilding but to help finance it through the provincial budget. Ezra 6:14 tells us that Haggai the prophet and Zechariah provided continuous encouragement and preaching during this time. Interestingly Ezra gives credit to God, Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes for completing the temple. In 516 B.C., Artaxerxes would not become king for another 50 years. This comment actually supports the identification of Ezra as author of the book of Ezra. He is giving Artaxerxes a nod of approval and appreciation for supporting Ezra’s own mission which will help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and the city itself, extending a greater protection to the temple. This is a transitional passage. Once the temple is rebuild the narrative advances 57 years to approximately 458 B.C. during the reign of Artaxerxes and the appearance of Ezra. Question: How do the exiles celebrate the reconstruction of the temple? Keep in mind the profound importance of this moment. The temple that Solomon built lasted from approximately 957 B.C. until 586 B.C. , more than 370 years, and was the center of religious life for Israel. The destruction of the temple and the dispersing of the population brought into question the very identity of Israel, and the distinctive worship relationship with God, established by Moses, and embodied by the temple. So this moment when temple is restored, with many of its original appointments and sacred vessels, regardless of how modest, is extraordinary and profound for the nation and history itself. This new temple will last until 70 A.D., more than 580 years. This is the temple that Herod the Great would improve and enlarge, the temple where Christ would enter in. Ezra 6:16 tells us that the priest, Levites, and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of the temple with joy. The reconstruction of the temple reestablishes the specialness of the Jerusalem, the Promised Land, and the people themselves which we see in in verse 19. Thousands of sacrifices had accompanied the dedication of Solomon’s temple. Here the modest number of slightly more than 700 would do; including a sin offering of 12 goats for each tribe. Significantly, the priests and Levites are formally reinstalled in the temple at this time, resuming their roles as required by, and recorded in the Book of Moses, referring to passages in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.Following this they celebrate Passover a month later. The celebrants are the returned exiles and those who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the LORD. This is extraordinarily significant and important in reestablishing the unique nature of Israel as God’s chosen people and the renewed significance of Jerusalem. It must have been a moment of great tension as well as great joy, because the Samaritans are shut out from the position they covet, which is the formal representative of the God of Israel in addition to all of the other pagan gods they embrace and condone. It is the triumph of faith and true relationship with God over convenience. God will not allow his purpose and vision for the world to be compromised or corrupted. God doesn’t need an empire, he doesn’t need political power or influence, he doesn’t need geopolitical alliances; first and foremost God wants people who believe in him. We, as believers, need to remember this. If God had not motivated Darius to decree a zone of protection for the exiles, this moment of celebration and worship would not have occurred. In Esther we saw that God could and would bless his chosen people in their new lives as exiles. In Ezra we see the continuing importance of the temple, Jerusalem, and the place that God had set aside as the Promised Land; so significant that it will be the place that Christ enters into the world.The Book of Ezra also stands as a confirming record for succeeding generations of Jews concerning the reestablishment of God’s temple, city, and his chosen people, dwelling in the world, but set apart. God did not intend or accept that they should become like the Samaritans"

There is a much greater focus on the journey itself. It took four months for them to cover the 900 miles. Question: What do we learn from Ezra’s journey that helps us on our own faith walk? It takes courage and God gives us that courage; and we should both acknowledge this and lean on it. At the end of chapter 7, Ezra says that “Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.” Ezra knew it would not be easy to convince people to go with him but that God would make it possible, by stirring the hearts of those he wanted to make the journey. The journey of faith is not perfect, and we should expect this. It doesn’t mean that God has abandoned us when there are failures, challenges, or glitches. Ezra assembles his travelers at the canal that flows towards Ahava and discovers that he has no Levites. The Levites were from the tribe of Levi and were men set apart, as clergy and servants, to do the administrative work of the temple. They served as temple guards, gatekeepers, and temple musician. They handled the special vessels in the temple and guarded the temple treasury. They also served as judges. They did not act as priests. Ezra needed them in order to ensure that the temple was running as God intended. Apparently God has placed on Ezra’s heart a concern that the last exiles who returned to Judah and Jerusalem are not being faithful in their actions. We will see that Ezra is exactly right in chapter 9. Ezra sends a delegation to a place called Casiphia (meaning ‘silvermith’), perhaps a location where Levites lived in Babylon. Ezra instructs the delegation to speak to the head of the Levites, a man named Iddo. 38 Levites and 220 temple slaves agree to go with Ezra. Ezra recognizes who made this possible. In verse 18 he says, ““And by the good hand of our God on us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen…”” We need to continuously pause and worship God and seek his guidance as we work; and especially in challenging and hectic times. Ezra has the assembled traveling party observe a time of fasting and worship to seek safe journey “for ourselves, our children, and all our goods.” Like Abraham rejecting the plunder obtained by men, Ezra has rejected the possibility of a military escort; telling Artaxerxes that they would rely on the hand of God to protect their journey. Together, everyone prays for God’s protection and invests time in the process of prayer and worship. Ezra values others as God values them; he sees others as God sees them; and he trusts those that God trusts. We need to do the same. After he weights out and accounts for the 25 tons of precious artifacts, gold, and silver he entrusts the priests to guard it with these words beginning in verse 28, ““You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers. (29) Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD.” (30) So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.”” Ezra mirrors God’s own view and so should we. As the returned exiles were completing the temple in 516 B.C. the prophet Zephaniah reminded them of God’s active love and regard for his people. In Zephaniah 3:17 he wrote, ““The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing.”” Ezra is consistent in demonstrating faithfulness. It’s not a one-time thing. When they arrive in Jerusalem four month later they take three days to rest and reflect on how the hand of God was on them for the entire 900 mile trip and protected them “from enemies and bandits along the way.”(v. 31). Ezra seeks no personal gain for himself and demonstrates his own trustworthiness. When he arrives in Jerusalem he again weighs out the large treasure of silver, gold, and valuable artifacts to demonstrate that it is all there and accounted for. Ezra honors the commitments he has made to others, even to a pagan king like Artaxerxes. When he returns to Jerusalem he fulfills the instruction in Artaxerxes’ letter (7:17) to offer appropriate sacrifices to God on the altar temple. Artaxerxes was avid for this offering to protect himself and his court from the possible wrath of the God of Israel. This occurs in 8:35; and Ezra turns it into an act of worship. Ezra is humble and self-effacing. He could have exerted the office of king’s favorite when he shows up in Jerusalem, but, with great temperance, he shares Artaxerxes’ letter, in v. 36, with the satraps and provincial governors throughout the region; extending this sharing with officials beyond the province of Trans-Euphrates itself so that everyone will know what Artaxerxes and the God of Israel have commanded. Ezra sets a greater example for everyone."

More than 100 religious and civil leaders, including priests and Levites working in the temple itself, had made the decision to intermarry with all the pagan peoples around them, including the descendants of the original corrupt Canaanite populations in the Promised Land; so have other prominent men among the returned exile families. God’s Law as shared with Moses specifically prohibited this. As we learned in Ruth, a foreign woman may marry a Jewish man if she is not a descendant of the Canaanites and if she adopts the Jewish faith. These pagan peoples, described in chapter 9   shared the same worship practices identified in 2 Kings 17:24-40, which  described the corrupted religious practices of the new inhabitants of Samaria in the north. Remember, the first exiles returned in 537 B.C and Ezra’s return was in 458 B.C.; so this practice of intermarrying with pagan cultures has been forming and under way for more than 70 years.

He was a man whom the king trusted absolutely, and whom was near to the king throughout much of the day in a way that few were. This was an ‘Esther’ job; in addition to commanding absolute, life-and-death trust, you had to look good, dress well, speak well, and understand Persian court manners. Nehemiah was giving an intricate performance each time he served the wine and was under constant scrutiny. The king even watched Nehemiah’s facial expressions as he served the wine to read how Nehemiah was feeling. (Nehemiah 2:2). F. Charles Fensham (The New International Commentary on the Old Testament:  The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah,1982, F.

Nehemiah was led by God to return to Judah in 445 B.C. following Ezra’s return in 458 B.C. Nehemiah was located in Susa, the winter capital of the Persian Empire, where Esther became Xerxes’ queen in 479/478 B.C. Artaxerxes was Xerxes’ son. Nehemiah was a powerful civil servant, cupbearer to King Artaxerxes; a position of fierce trust and accountability, which made Nehemiah part of the king’s inner circle. The cupbearer was accountable for serving the king’s wine whenever the king was drinking, and to guard and taste the king’s wine, which in Persia was often and plentiful, to be certain it wasn’t poisoned. He was a man whom the king trusted absolutely, and whom was near to the king throughout much of the day in a way that few were. This was an ‘Esther’ job; in addition to commanding absolute, life-and-death trust, you had to look good, dress well, speak well, and understand Persian court manners. Nehemiah was giving an intricate performance each time he served the wine and was under constant scrutiny. The king even watched Nehemiah’s facial expressions as he served the wine to read how Nehemiah was feeling. (Nehemiah 2:2). F. Charles Fensham (The New International Commentary on the Old Testament: The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah,1982, F. Charles Fensham, p. 157) observes that Nehemiah’s job probably meant that he was a eunuch. As cupbearer he came into contact with the king’s harem and with the queen and the concubines as well. Nehemiah was born in Persia, was an urban, palace-dweller, had power, trust, a great job, a cushy lifestyle, and was present almost every time the king made a decision that affected the empire. Remember Herodotus, the Greek historian (484 B.C. to 425 B.C.), studied the Persian’s extensively, and wrote this about their drinking and decision making: Nehemiah had no good reason to think about relocating to Judah. He had every reason to stay where he was. But the books of Esther, Ezra, and Nehemiah are first and foremost about God’s vision and intention for his people. Among his characteristics, God is the great builder. Think about the order in which he reestablished Judah: The identity of the returning exiles and the chosen people in Judah is rebuilt and the foundation of the temple is reestablished (genealogy at beginning of the Book of Ezra 537 B.C.) The temple is rebuilt (516 B.C.) Family integrity is rebuilt (no more marriages to women and men from pagan cultures, 458 B.C.) The walls of Jerusalem are rebuilt; and Jerusalem is reestablished as a substantial city and destination, worthy to host the rebuilt temple (Nehemiah 445/444 B.C.)"

Sanballat, who is identified as the governor of the province by the Elephantine papyri and Tobiah the Ammonite, a Jewish name, meaning he was a Jew appointed to govern the region of Ammon, are joined in opposing Nehemiah. Question: Once Nehemiah makes his inspection he returns to the other Jewish leaders and makes his case to rebuild the walls. What does he say? His first approach is negative. He also appeals to the powers of observation of his listeners. They have seen the ruined walls every day: “You can see for yourselves the trouble we are in while Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates burned.” What this means is that Nehemiah is giving specificity to the challenges they face. Without a protecting wall and secure gates there can be no safety for the residents or the temple itself. Jerusalem cannot be regarded as a serious city or location for worship. Nehemiah is also stating a clear and urgent accountability. Nehemiah and the other Jewish leaders who see the ruins each day are accountable to God to rebuild the city. In verse 17 he says, “Come let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem and we will no longer be in disgrace.” Nehemiah is saying we can’t rest or relent until Jerusalem becomes a defensible and worthy center for worship. In verse 18 Nehemiah shares a more positive encouragement. “I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me, and what the king had said to me.” Nehemiah now shares his testimony, concerning how God convicted him, and then how God interceded to guide the words and actions of Artaxerxes. Like Ezra, Nehemiah starts with the importance of God and God’s intercession, rather than the authority given him by the king or the letter of authority that he carries. This is important because God needs for the returned exiles to understand that he is working through Nehemiah. Within the frame of the Persian court, Nehemiah is a much higher ranking and more influential official than Ezra was, and much more closely aligned with the Persians. It would have been easy for the returned exiles to see Nehemiah as a Persian or the friend of Artaxerxes, rather than one of God’s chosen people. Ezra was a priest and a descendant of Aaron, learned in the law. Nehemiah was the king’s cupbearer, a sophisticated insider at Artaxerxes’ court. Also critical here, Nehemiah has to persuade the Jewish leaders to take on the task of rebuilding the walls. This is not easy. They have already been thwarted once and seen their work destroyed, and have grown use to simply living amidst the ruins. The response to Nehemiah’s testimony is powerful and affirming. The leaders respond, “Let us start rebuilding.” The English Standard Version is “Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good work.” From this version we get a sense of encouragement, affirmation, and mutual support. ‘If God wants us to do this we can.’ Now comes another key moment. Once Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite, and a new third administrator, Geshem the Arab, hear of Nehemiah’s initiative, they act immediately and don’t hold back. Nehemiah records, “they jeered at us and despised us and said, “What is this thing you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?” From a worldly perspective Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem are good, smart, and active. They attack immediately and use their best weapons. First mockery. The world uses this against followers of Christ all the time, so we need to learn from Nehemiah’s account. Mockery, ‘social shaming’, is one of the most powerful tools in attacking the work that God calls us to do. We are constantly bombarded with stories that tell us that Christianity is dying, failing, stupid, simple, careless, or untrue. Second, Sanballat, Tobiah, and Gesham misapply the best authority they have, which is the previous letter that Artaxerxes wrote, some years ago, ending the previous reconstruction of Jerusalem and its walls. Even though Nehemiah’s new letter of authority from Artaxerxes supersedes the previous order, Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem know that misdirection, confusion, and uncertainty are their best allies. Nehemiah’s response to them is instructive for us. The Complete Jewish Bible captures Nehemiah’s words this way, “But I answered them: “The God of heaven will enable us to succeed. Therefore we his servants will set about rebuilding. But you have no share, right or history to commemorate in Yerushalayim.” First Nehemiah says the most important thing. This project belongs to God, so God will be the one to grant its success, not Nehemiah, not Artaxerxes, not any worldly authority. It is not a personal matter or conflict between Nehemiah and these three enemies of progress. Second Nehemiah uses God’s greater purpose as the reason for action. It is not Nehemiah’s preference or idea, it is God’s. Third Nehemiah honors God’s instruction to make this project the work of God’s people alone. The temple and the city will be rebuilt not by the Persians, not by the Samaritans, not by the Egyptians or the Canaanites, but by the Israelites. This is still the Promised Land, and the Jews are still God’s chosen people. Faith matters. God matters. They set us apart in ways that are powerful, dynamic, and sacred, and which should fill us with humble rejoicing. One person who was extremely happy to hear Nehemiah’s response was Ezra. Nehemiah reaffirmed the authority that Artaxerxes had given Ezra to monitor and revive the right worship of God, and the distinct and special character of the Jews as God’s chosen people. It also distinguishes us as Nehemiah’s heirs through Christ. We are here to build and affirm according to God’s purposes, not to destroy and mock as the world does. It calls to mind Paul’s words in I Corinthians 15:57-58: “(57) But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. (58) Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain."

When Sanballat, governor of Trans-Eurphrates, hears that Nehemiah has begun reconstruction of the Jerusalem wall his anger explodes. Question: Sanballat’s reaction is the same reaction we often face as Christ’s church today. What is it? Beginning in verse four we see Nehemiah’s own reaction, which is important for us to understand. How does Nehemiah respond? Sanballat goes back to the first approach he used in Nehemiah 3:10, mockery and scorn, because these are so powerful. And, in verse two he makes this mockery a public and broad undertaking by doing it in front of his fellow administrators and the Samaritan army, which is the militia based defensive force for the province. He knows that all these people are connected by kinship, friendship, and business relationships with the various Jewish families helping to rebuild the wall. Some of these Jewish families are also engaged in undermining the reconstruction. Sanballat is using the ancient version of publicity. Sanballat attacks the Jews personally, calling them feeble. He attacks their project: “Will they restore their wall?” He attacks their God as ineffective: “Will they offer sacrifices?” He exaggerates and ridicules their ambitions: “Will they finish in a day?” He observes that the rubble is insufficient to build anything; knowing that all this will get back to the Jews. Sanballat’s toady, Tobiah the Ammonite, “who was at his side” joins in the mockery: “What they are building –even if a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!” So Sanballat uses public mockery, personal attack, distortion of facts, and appeals to sympathetic audiences as his primary instruments to derail work on the wall. All of these attacks come directly to Nehemiah. Nehemiah must have had a steady stream of people approaching him each day, and saying “guess what I heard?” And other people saying, “this task is impossible,” or “let’s wait for a better moment.” Nehemiah must have felt some anger, disappointment, and increasing impatience.

Jeremiah 29:13 says, “ You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.” We see that Nehemiah, with God’s help, has made this part of his faith walk with God. This orientation means that Nehemiah doesn’t put himself first. His petition begins with the recognition that it is God himself and the Jews who are being mocked. His request is that God hold the Samaritans and their allies accountable for their mockery. Nehemiah trusts God’s hand to administer justice, not his own. He may have been remembering Psalms 1 which says: “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; (2) but his delight is in the law[b] of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night.

(5) Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; (6) for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” In the next verse, verse 6, Nehemiah tells us that after the onset of this campaign of jeering and mockery the Israelites were able to rebuild the wall to half its height, because “the people worked with all their heart.” This is a direct message to us, telling us to follow Nehemiah’s blue print. When under attack, when mocked, when subject to slander and distortion, turn first to Christ and God and seek their intervention and justice; let Christ define your behavior, your action, and your well-being. This approach enables us to endure the greatest stress, storms, and opposition. Nehemiah’s faithfulness does not end the conflict. When Sanballat hears that the work continues, he ratchets up the pressure and opposition. Verse seven tells us that when he hears that the repairs have gone ahead, he rallies opposition from all quarters: The Ammonites to the east, the Arabs to the south, the men of Ashdod to the west, and the Samaritans to the north. Judah was cut off. Not only was Judah surrounded by hostile camps, but Sanballat and his confederates also threatened an attack on Jerusalem itself. The stakes are higher. Nehemiah’s response to this is to have the people joined in continual prayer to God, and to post a guard day and night. This is a sober and wise response. The first emphasis is on prayer, the second on action guided by that prayer. As Nehemiah leads his people in a time of great challenge and opposition he is also setting an example that is direct testimony as to what it means to belong to God, and to exemplify God’s character, the sort of example that Paul identified in Colossians 4: “(2) Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. (3) At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison— (4) that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. (5) Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. (6) Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.” Also Ephesian 6:18, “And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.” The next challenge is the hardest one of all, and that is internal discouragement. This is very much a common challenge for us as well, and enormously important for us to understand. Question: In what ways do the Israelites demonstrate discouragement? What do we learn from this and what is Nehemiah’s reaction? First, in verse 10, there is a general murmuring across the entire province of Judah that the workers in Jerusalem are giving out, and the rubble is too vast to clear away. In other words the task is impossible there aren’t enough people to do it, and we are failing. The scripture’s sense is that these sentiments were repeated over and over again. Then the Jews living close to the borders to Judah, abutting the regions where the opposition lived, kept coming to Jerusalem and warning Nehemiah and his workers that they would be attacked and killed at any time. In verse 12 Nehemiah describes this as being told “ten times over….” Remember that this wide spread fear, anxiety, forecasting of failure and disaster, and naysaying was going on at the same time Nehemiah was praying to God himself, and had his workers praying to God around the clock. So what we learn is that even as we seek faithful and prayerful purpose, there will be doubt, fear, confusion, and anxiety about where things are headed. This should be expected and not cause us to waiver if we have prayerfully sought God’s guidance. Nehemiah addressed this in several ways. First he stationed armed guards along the wall where everyone could see them. Then Nehemiah encouraged everyone: Nehemiah used encouragement rather than criticism. He invoked God rather than his own authority, and he reminded the Israelites that they shared a common identity in God, and so had a divine and sacred accountability to fight for one another. These verses remind us of Christ’s own words concerning fear in Matthew 10, beginning in verse 26. We are not to fear those who seek our harm or to intimidate; rather we are to fear only God who has the power of life and death and the power to save or condemn our very souls. For us fear of the Lord begins with an understanding of his love and compassion and protection; his great regard for us. If we believe in Christ as the Son of God, then God will never be separated from us, regardless of peril: “(26) So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. (27) What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. (28) And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. (29) Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. (30) But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. (31) Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. (32) So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, (33) but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.” Nehemiah had these words from Isaiah 41 which may have convicted him and certainly gave him profound guidance and comfort: “But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the offspring of Abraham, my friend; (9) you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, “You are my servant, I have chosen you and not cast you off”; (10) fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. (11) Behold, all who are incensed against you shall be put to shame and confounded; those who strive against you shall be as nothing and shall perish. (12) You shall seek those who contend with you, but you shall not find them; those who war against you shall be as nothing at all. (13) For I, the LORD your God, hold your right hand; it is I who say to you, “Fear not, I am the one who helps you."

As governor, he was required to set an extensive table each day, receiving and feeding as many as 150 officials, dignitaries from surrounding nations, and other visitors. He paid for all of this out of his own pocket for 12 years. At the end of this passage, Nehemiah asks God to remember him with favor for all that he has done for the people. This may sound self-aggrandizing but it’s not. Nehemiah is asking that God establish the value of his service, and that God accept his faithfulness. He is not asking for wealth, power, fame, immortality, or the destruction of his enemies. D. L. Moody wrote, “A holy life will produce the deepest impression. Lighthouses blow no horns; they only shine.” Nehemiah shines. Warren Wiersbe (Be Determined) writes that chapter 5 teaches us four important things: First, problems will arise among the people we lead or work with, no matter how noble the enterprise, how well-intended the efforts, and regardless of whether we share the same faith. Second, God calls on us to address these problems with his courage, his counsel, his restraint, his valuing of other lives and voices, and his honesty and encouragement. Third, we must act with God’s integrity as we strive to help solve the problems and challenges that arise. This requires sacrifice, vigilance, self-reflection, continuous prayer, and keeping God at the center of everything. Fourth, each problem, each challenge, each difficult or disappointing moment is an opportunity for God to work; to demonstrate his character, demonstrate his presence in the world, and demonstrate his faithful lovingkindness, mercy, and divine wisdom."

Nehemiah knows this and won’t travel to meet Sanballat and his cronies. Rather than ignoring Sanballat’s letters, and there were four of them, Nehemiah answers each one. Question: What does Nehemiah say and why does he answer each letter? Nehemiah sends messengers to Sanballat saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” He responds in exactly this way to each of the four letters. What we know is that Nehemiah’s words about “a great work” didn’t refer to his own private actions but to the work that God had instructed him to do. We are able to draw this conclusion because Nehemiah’s behavior up to this point was impeccable, and observed by everyone; the kind of selfless, servant leadership that God and Christ truly value. Hebrews 13: 7 says, “Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.” This is Nehemiah in both word and action.

God had used Hanani to reach Nehemiah and begin the formation of new purpose in Nehemiah’s life to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Nehemiah also commanded caution. In the ancient world it was customary to open the city gates at dawn and to keep them open until nightfall. Nehemiah instructed that a shorter schedule be set. The gates were not to open until the sun was high and hot, midmorning, and they were to be shut while all of the gatekeepers and guards were still on watch, which may have meant that the gates closed sooner than nightfall.",

Nehemiah had not been able to see this as managed the rebuilding of the wall foot by foot, and also addressed an endless river of problems. This often happens to us. God gives us a greater purpose and we lose sight of it amid details, daily challenges, and momentary disappointments. Nehemiah saw some of the scale of God’s greater purpose and God’s vision for rebuilding the city that would host Christ himself. Second, Nehemiah saw that the city was nearly empty.

        "content": "At the beginning of chapter 7, two administrators, with similar names, Hanani and Hananiah , are appointed over Jerusalem for the first time since the exiles have returned. Hanani was Nehemiah’s brother and had first brought news to Nehemiah of Jerusalem’s disrepair. God had used Hanani to reach Nehemiah and begin the formation of new purpose in Nehemiah’s life to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. Nehemiah also commanded caution. In the ancient world it was customary to open the city gates at dawn and to keep them open until nightfall. Nehemiah instructed that a shorter schedule be set. The gates were not to open until the sun was high and hot, midmorning, and they were to be shut while all of the gatekeepers and guards were still on watch, which may have meant that the gates closed sooner than nightfall. Nehemiah stood back and looked at the work of 52 days. What he saw amazed him and was also a revelation. First even though the walls have been reconstructed around the smaller perimeter of the Jerusalem that David knew, the reconstructed area was still large and spacious compared to the unpassable piles of rubble Nehemiah scouted when he first arrived in Jerusalem. Nehemiah had not been able to see this as managed the rebuilding of the wall foot by foot, and also addressed an endless river of problems. This often happens to us. God gives us a greater purpose and we lose sight of it amid details, daily challenges, and momentary disappointments. Nehemiah saw some of the scale of God’s greater purpose and God’s vision for rebuilding the city that would host Christ himself. Second, Nehemiah saw that the city was nearly empty. They had focused with all zeal on the walls themselves, which was exactly God’s intention, and now Nehemiah saw that few people actually lived in Jerusalem and many of the houses needed to be rebuilt. When it comes to paying attention to God Nehemiah had proven himself to be an acute and passionate listener. He went to God first, listened to God first, and sought his direction from God first, in all circumstances – good, bad, frustrating, scary, and seemingly hopeless. When Nehemiah thought about rebuilding the houses and repopulating the city, the first thing God gave him was not another accelerated building plan but a clear purposeful desire “to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. Then God directed Nehemiah to the vast genealogical record first created when Zerubbabel led the first exiles back to Jerusalem nearly a century before in 537 B.C., during the reign of Cyrus the Great. Remember Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem in 444 B.C., 93 years later. Over the next 67 verses Nehemiah restates this genealogical record of names and families. Question: Other than testing our reading comprehension and wakefulness why does God lead Nehemiah to do this? The Promised Land had a different significance than any other geography in the world. Families occupied land based on agreements starting between God and Moses and then God and Joshua. Nehemiah wanted to create a comprehensive list so that he could see where families had originally lived, and especially the families that had lived in Jerusalem, so that he could encourage them to return. It’s a connecting moment of significance. God was telling the returned exiles, and us today, that if we labor for God and with God it will never be anonymous or without greater purpose. The return of the 42,000 exiles in 537 B.C. led to the work of the exiles in 444 B.C. raising Jerusalem from the rubble. Our work in Christ’s name builds for God over time both to the benefit of heaven and to succeeding generations. God connects and multiplies our work for him in powerful ways. The lists here in Nehemiah chapter 7 and in Ezra chapter 2, are like the list in Hebrews 11, enumerating people of faith, people who are part of God’s family, people whose lives and actions had eternal consequence and who were personally known to God. In Isaiah 8:18 Isaiah wrote “Here am I, and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.” These named people were the distinct living evidence, signs of God at work in the world, just as we are today. God reminds us that people are important to him. He cared about these struggling returned exiles as he cares about us, and he knew them by name. Hebrews 11:1-2 says, “Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, and certain of what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for.” There are some discrepancies between the list in Ezra and the list in Nehemiah. These are mostly total numbers, spellings, and ordering of family names, reflecting modifications that may have been made to the list over those 93 intervening years. But the lists are mostly and powerfully the same, announcing a great continuity and stating with conviction that God is indeed paying attention to both his people and their work in the world. "

Cyrus also conquered the city of Babylon. His rule is documented in the book of Ezra. Ezra 1:1 says, “In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken to Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing.” This decree permitted the followers of God, living in exile, to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple. Many returned but not everyone did. Esther’s ancestors are among these who stayed in exile. Once of the questions raised in Esther is will God keep his covenant promises for those Jews who no longer live in the Promised Land? One of the primary theological focuses for the book of Esther is that God fulfills his covenant promises across both history and the sea of imperfect human responses, by his greater and divine providence. Karen Jobes writes, “The great paradox of Esther is that God is omnipotently present even where God is most conspicuously absent.” Cyrus the Great was followed by four other kings, Cambyses II, Bardiya, Darius I the Great, and then King Xerxes who is the Xerxes of Esther, in 486 BC. He is the same Xerxes who did battle with the Spartans at Thermopylae, captured Athens, and whose fleet was soundly beaten by the Greeks at Salamis in 480 BC. Ezra 4:6 tells us that it is during Xerxes’ reign that Persian leaders began to strongly oppose the rebuilding of the Temple at Jerusalem. In less than 120 years, following the assassination of Xerxes in 465 BC, the Persian themselves would be conquered by Alexander the Great. Xerxes ruled from four cities, Babylon, Persepolis, Ecbatana, and Susa; with Susa being the most active. The king and his retinue would be found in Susa in the winter months, because in the summer it was too hot. Daniel 8:2 tells us that Daniel had a vision of himself in the citadel of Susa. Jewish and Arab traditions say that Daniel was buried in Susa. Today the remains of Susa lie within the borders of Iran. "

        "content": "Question: In Ruth we saw a foreigner, Ruth the Moabitess, working hard to conform to Jewish Law and custom, in Esther we see a Jewish woman, Esther, who must deny her heritage. Do we see any evidence of God at work in this forsaken setting? Several times we read that Esther has earned favor with others. What does this tell us about her character and behavior? Despite harrowing circumstances, Esther, much like Ruth, must have demonstrated a substantial trustworthiness, grace, humility, and interest in the well-being of others, in this case Hegai the eunuch, so much so that she won Hegai’s favor. This ensured that she would have the best place to live in the harem, the support of seven maids from the king’s palace, the best food to eat, and the benefit of Hegai’s counsel in preparing over 12 months for her encounter with Xerxes. Verse 10 shares that Esther had hidden her Jewish heritage, at Mordecai’s instruction. Every day Mordecai walks to the region of the harem “to learn how Esther was and what was happening to her.” Mordecai could only get this close if he were a fairly significant court official. It also tells us that that Mordecai was anxious, concerned, and fretful about Esther’s new job description. Mordecai knew what Xerxes was like, and he knew the dangers of palace life. Esther had probably shared her fears and unhappiness with Mordecai. Mordecai values her and doesn’t abandon her. When Esther’s time to sleep with Xerxes arrives she has the right to ask for anything to take to the king from the harem. This is sex on an industrial scale. Once a virgin sleeps with the king she is then turned over to a different eunuch, Shaashgaz, and housed among the concubines, not among the virgins. She may not return to the king unless he specifically summons her. This is what Esther is headed towards. All of this violates Jewish law and she knows this. All she asks for is Hegai’s advice before going to the palace. It is in verse 15 we read that “Esther was winning favor in the eyes of all who saw her.” What does this mean for a woman at this time? Not that that she is a great warrior, prophet, or administrator. It means that her behavior is consistently beyond reproach, she treats others with respect and compassion, she is a good listener, and she earns the trust of others. At the beginning of verse 16 Esther is described as “the daughter of Abihail” mentioning her father’s name for the first time. Abihail means “strong father or strong cause.” We get the impression from the careful depiction of Esther’s Jewish lineage that God’s values, the values he intended for the chosen people in the Promised Land, have in large degree traveled with her; that the faith and lives of her family, now dead or separated by exile have influenced her own life and faith, in ways that, although not directly addressed in the Book of Esther, are real and guiding, and open to the influence of God.

        "paragraph1": "What makes Esther’s courage in approaching Xerxes on behalf of Mordecai and the Jews living in exile even more remarkable is the intentional isolation she has been forced to live in. She is kept apart from the king for long stretches of time, and purposefully shielded from news of the world around her. Esther did not know about Haman’s well publicized edict commanding extermination of the Jews until Mordecai shared it with her through the court eunuch Hathatch. Esther’s life is defined by leisure, banquets, the excessive drinking that the Persian’s  loved, and a complete lack of privacy as she lived out her life in the presence of a host of servants; some spying on behalf of the king, and others spying on behalf of the king’s inner circle. The culture of Xerxes’ court was not designed to encourage the power and prestige of women but to minimize them. It would have been easy for Esther to be numbed by all this, and reduced to passive inaction, but she rises above the corrupting softness and indulgence, and risks all in the name of God and his chosen people. We see in her actions the reflection of David’s own journey and his words in Psalm 86, words Mordecai and Esther may have known :  ",

Even this only leads to corruption, decay, and death. Xerxes has a sense of this however brief. God is near him this night.",
        "paragraph2b": "Remember that the chronicle is always updated in the king’s presence so the story it tells is designed to be flattering to the king. Xerxes commands the attendants to read, going back at least five years before, because the record recounts the saving service done by Mordecai in disclosing the plan by Bigthana and Teresh, two of Xerxes’ trusted guards, to assassinate him. He is startled afresh by the account and wants to know immediately if Mordecai was ever rewarded. God has used this moment with exquisite timing. Xerxes is listening, open, sober, and there isn’t that vast noise of his court trying to influence him. He’s thinking about his own legacy and mortality as king, and the perfect opportunity arises for him to confirm his power, his largess and liberality, and to cement the loyal of one of his subjects by finally rewarding Mordecai. It’s the sort of impulsive behavior we have seen repeatedly in Xerxes, but this time God uses that character flaw to accomplish his specific purposes.",

        "content": "What makes Esther’s courage in approaching Xerxes on behalf of Mordecai and the Jews living in exile even more remarkable is the intentional isolation she has been forced to live in. She is kept apart from the king for long stretches of time, and purposefully shielded from news of the world around her. Esther did not know about Haman’s well publicized edict commanding extermination of the Jews until Mordecai shared it with her through the court eunuch Hathatch. Esther’s life is defined by leisure, banquets, the excessive drinking that the Persian’s loved, and a complete lack of privacy as she lived out her life in the presence of a host of servants; some spying on behalf of the king, and others spying on behalf of the king’s inner circle. The culture of Xerxes’ court was not designed to encourage the power and prestige of women but to minimize them. It would have been easy for Esther to be numbed by all this, and reduced to passive inaction, but she rises above the corrupting softness and indulgence, and risks all in the name of God and his chosen people. We see in her actions the reflection of David’s own journey and his words in Psalm 86, words Mordecai and Esther may have known: “(14) O God, arrogant men attack me; a gang of ruthless men, who do not respect you, seek my life. (15) But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God. You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love and faithfulness. (16) Turn toward me and have mercy on me! Give your servant your strength! Deliver your slave! (17) Show me evidence of your favor!” That night, after the first banquet, Xerxes’ cannot sleep, so he has the chronicles of his reign read to him. This is a poignant moment. You can almost hear Xerxes’ longing for significance and affirmation in commanding this reading: ‘Have I been a good king? Will I be remembered?’ In Xerxes we see earthly power without God. Even this only leads to corruption, decay, and death. Xerxes has a sense of this however brief. God is near him this night. Remember that the chronicle is always updated in the king’s presence so the story it tells is designed to be flattering to the king. Xerxes commands the attendants to read, going back at least five years before, because the record recounts the saving service done by Mordecai in disclosing the plan by Bigthana and Teresh, two of Xerxes’ trusted guards, to assassinate him. He is startled afresh by the account and wants to know immediately if Mordecai was ever rewarded. God has used this moment with exquisite timing. Xerxes is listening, open, sober, and there isn’t that vast noise of his court trying to influence him. He’s thinking about his own legacy and mortality as king, and the perfect opportunity arises for him to confirm his power, his largess and liberality, and to cement the loyal of one of his subjects by finally rewarding Mordecai. It’s the sort of impulsive behavior we have seen repeatedly in Xerxes, but this time God uses that character flaw to accomplish his specific purposes. Question: This is a pivotal moment that begins the decisive shift of power and influence away from Haman and to Esther, Mordecai and the Jews. What does this teach us? God can reach anyone at any time. He is not subject to our schedules or limited imaginations. In this moment of great influence, Xerxes is about alone as he ever is, trying to sleep and failing. There are no state dinners, no formal meetings, no phalanx of advisors, or intricate plots. There is a king in his sleeping attire reminded of the extraordinary good service rendered by one of God’s people five years before. Nor does God need for Xerxes’ to suddenly become godly, good, or wise; he uses Xerxes’ own nature to accomplish his greater purpose which is to bring attention to Mordecai and Mordecai’s faithfulness which will help lead to deliverance for the exiled Jews. The works we, as believers, do in God’s name never go to waste. Sometimes we think God is not listening or that we have failed because we don’t get the effect or result we long for, at the moment we want it. God’s view is much longer than ours. When Mordecai saved the king from assassination and received no recognition in return, and then had to watch Haman’s elevation, he must have felt that God was ignoring him and the complete lack of any justice for his faithfulness. Five years later God directs Xerxes’ sleepy mind to Mordecai’s service and the result is far more powerful and useful than anything Mordecai could have imagined or wanted. Our confidence should first be in God and not our own design. The Book of Esther is thick with plotting, maneuvering, and state craft but neither Mordecai nor Esther could have predicted or engineered the outcome that God brought about. We should not take God’s intervention for granted or lightly assume that we may predict it. We need to seek him with faithfulness, persistence, and humility and should not be put off by the doubts or dry times that will certainly occur. Christ gave us the model for this in the parable of the persistent widow in Luke 18:1-8: “Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart. (2) He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people. (3) There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ (4) For a while he refused, but later on he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor have regard for people, (5) yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’” (6) And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says! (7) Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them? (8) I tell you, he will give them justice speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”The widow is not presented in an endearing way and the judge despises her and ignores her as long as he can. Yet, said God, I listen, respond, and dispense mercy to you who believe in me in moments just like these, and with a motive driven by my love for you; don’t abandon your faith. Isaiah 55: 3, 4 & 6-9 capture God’s greater design in God’s own voice with startling power: “Pay attention and come to me! Listen, so you can live! Then I will make an unconditional covenantal promise to you, just like the reliable covenantal promises I made to David. (4) Look, I made him a witness to nations, a ruler and commander of nations….(6) Seek the LORD while he makes himself available; call to him while he is nearby! (7) The wicked need to abandon their lifestyle and sinful people their plans. They should return to the LORD, and he will show mercy to them, and to their God, for he will freely forgive them. (8) “Indeed, my plans are not like your plans, and my deeds are not like your deeds, (9) for just as the sky is higher than the earth, so my deeds are superior to your deeds and my plans superior to your plans.” Ironically Haman cannot wait to have Mordecai impaled, so is waiting to see Xerxes’ at the crack of dawn. He has already authorized construction of the gallows. Question: What do we need to understand about the true character of the wicked? Psalm 36: 1-4 gives us extraordinary insight. It’s written by David and it reflects a revelation that God gave David concerning the true character of the wicked: “(1) An evil man is rebellious to the core. He does not fear God, (2) for he is too proud to recognize and give up his sin. (3) The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful; he does not care about doing what is wise and right. (4) He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed; he is committed to a sinful lifestyle; he does not reject what is evil.” This is a perfect rendering of Haman’s character and heart. He is obsessed with his power and with doing harm to those who don’t fear or respect it. He hates the Israelites because, as God’s chosen people, they are his hereditary enemies, and he has committed his full influence and resources to destroying them. He literally can’t wait to do the next bad thing. Evil drive him. What is the answer to the formidable and active impulse of the wicked to do harm and to slander the name of God? David also supplies the answer in Psalm 36:5-10: “O LORD, your loyal love reaches to the sky; your faithfulness to the clouds. (6) Your justice is like the highest mountains, your fairness like the deepest sea; you preserve mankind and the animal kingdom. (7) How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race finds shelter under your wings. (8) They are filled with food from your house, and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies. (9) For you are the one who gives and sustains life. (10) Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers, and vindicate the morally upright!” God’s love and justice are our refuge."

        ],
        "content": "While Haman is reeling from a punctured ego he is summoned to attend the second banquet set up by Queen Esther. Esther must now share her request with Xerxes in front of Haman. Remember that Esther’s circumstances have not changed. She has not been given greater freedom, or unlimited access to the king, or greater status; she has not been allowed to emerge from the managed isolation of her quarters. She does not know that Xerxes has had a sleepless night, and may not even know that Xerxes has forced Haman to honor Mordecai. As far as she knows Haman is as powerful as ever. It is remarkable that she has included Haman at the banquet. It would have been easier for Esther to have asked to speak to the king alone, outside of Haman’s presence, just as Haman sought to speak to Xerxes alone when he wanted to kill Mordecai. What Esther knows is that she has one moment in which to attempt to influence the king. Her courage, steadiness, humility, and wisdom are extraordinary; and a model for us in learning servant leadership. Question: Just as we see the absence of God in Haman’s character, we see the presence of God in Esther’s character. What evidence do we see in chapter 7? Esther’s beginning language, as she makes her petition, is gentle and modest. She does not assert her identity or privilege as queen. Xerxes is a giant jerk, an impulsive cad, and a megalomaniac but Esther addresses him with profound respect and deference, just like Daniel did, and Joseph did. Her words are all about how the king feels, “If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life -- this is my petition.” Esther is also fearless in identifying herself personally with the request. Her opening words proclaim, “Xerxes if you don’t grant this then I will die too.” Esther’s language is plain and truthful. In verse 4 her description of the deed to come “For I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation…” mirrors the language of the decree drawn by Haman himself in Esther 3:13. Haman, who is sitting there, cannot object, because Esther is essentially quoting him. She also frames the dire nature of the situation for Xerxes, saying, ‘if this weren’t such a horrible thing, if it was only about further enslavement, I would not bother you with this.’ Notice too that Esther does not jump the gun. She does not start with accusation; she starts with an even-handed description of the issue; just like the prophet Nathan, when he confronted David about Bathsheba. Esther also demonstrates that she is a great leader. In this moment she is the Queen of her exiled people and has taken up their cause, at the highest level, when no one else can. God has indeed appointed her for this moment. We see Xerxes at full impulse. He has no recollection of the decree he’s signed against the Jews and demands to know “where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?” We see several things here. Xerxes demonstrates the historic tendency of all autocrats to not take responsibility for their actions. He gave Haman his signet ring and his authorization but that is now conveniently forgotten. Also, kings, whether good or bad, tend to be notoriously busy and move on from past decisions to the next thing. Esther recognizes all this in how she frames her request. Esther is observing the admonition found in Ephesians 4:29, “Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.” Remarkably, even as she makes her petition, Esther is also giving grace to Xerxes. We also see something akin to the Holy Spirit at work in Esther, reflecting what Paul wrote in I Corinthians 12:7-9, “(7) The Holy Spirit is given to each of us in a special way. That is for the good of all. (8) To some people the Spirit gives a message of wisdom. To others the same Spirit gives a message of knowledge. (9) To others the same Spirit gives faith.” We clearly see God at work in Esther, and Esther’s character becomes like God’s. She speaks with an inspiration, temperance, and self-abnegation that is beyond the reach of human action, and clearly within the realm of God. The rest of chapter 7 is dark. Esther accuses Haman – “the adversary and the enemy is this vile Haman” - and Xerxes has him executed on the very seven story gallows that Haman built for Mordecai. Question: Some commentators say that Esther should have exercised more charity and mercy here, rather than accomplishing Haman’s execution. Do you agree? Remember that Esther, like Mordecai, is from the tribe of Benjamin, which was also the tribe of King Saul, and that Saul lost his right of kingship because he disobeyed God’s command, shared through the prophet Samuel, to attack and exterminate the Amalekites and their king, Agag, who were devout enemies of Israel. Now a second monarch from the tribe of Benjamin faces a blood descendant of the Amalekites, whose evil malice in the service of Xerxes and threat to annihilate the exiled Jewish population is directly traceable to Saul’s disobedience. Esther will not make the same mistake. Haman is not repentant or regretful; verse 6 tells us that he was terrified and undone that Xerxes had turned against him. He begs Esther for his life, not for forgiveness. God knows Haman’s heart and is administering the justice that Haman deserves. As Paul wrote in Galatians 6: 7-8, “Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. 8 For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.” Remember that Haman still wears the king’s signet ring and carries the power of Xerxes wherever he goes. Given Xerxes’ distracted state, Haman could have fomented rebellion against Xerxes himself and then fulfilled his plan to exterminate the Jews. Esther cannot allow that possibility. In addition, the only way to counteract the original edict of extermination was to create a new edict that granted the Jews a greater right of self-defense that the original right to exterminate them. Haman’s power, which is in the service of evil, must end. Throughout scripture God makes clear that the wicked will receive his justice.

Some say she died when she was still young and others that she lived to an old age. We don’t know.",
        "content": "We get a strong sense of the division and volatility within the Persian Empire by the reaction to the two edicts. There is still a strong element across many of the 127 provinces that is committed to attacking the Jews despite the issuance of the second decree and the fall of Haman. These are probably allies who remain true to the power of Haman’s household, opportunists who want to seize additional wealth (plunder), and those who view this war of competing edicts as a referendum on the power of Xerxes and Mordecai. At this point in his reign Xerxes is not beloved by his people. His failed expeditions against the Greeks have resulted in catastrophic casualties, huge investments, near bankruptcy, and much higher taxes. Question: Are the Jews excessive or vindictive in their response? Although there is some fuzziness in the language it is most likely that the Jews are attacking only those who attack them first. The enemies arrayed against the Jews are seeking not simply to defeat or embarrass them, but to wipe them from the face of the earth. Part of the Jewish response is to simply ensure that the people seeking their annihilation aren’t around to do it again. Part of this battle is completing the holy war against the Amalekites; and in aid of this they kill the 10 sons of Haman who have taken up arms against them. Queen Esther requests that their dead bodies be put on public display (9:13) just like the bodies of King Saul and his sons were put on display by the Philistines at Beth-Shan. Esther’s request to extend the edict for one more day may seem blood thirsty or punitive but it’s really not. Many commentators view this as excessive vengeance or the triumph of blood lust but there are practical reasons for Esther to make her request. There is a pitched battle going on across the 127 provinces of the empire, and it will take more than one day to resolve. What is unspoken here is that the Jews must have suffered losses as well, even though permitted to take up arms in self-defense, and even though they have the support of Xerxes’ nobles, satraps, governor, and administrators. This is a messy moment and we can imagine that the enemies of the Jews are fighting as hard as they can to achieve the results promised in the first edict, and not the second. As Warren Wiersbe writes (Be Committed: Doing God’s Will Whatever the Cost, David C. Cook, 1993, p. 180, “The fear of God protects those who fear God and believe His promises. Because the Jews believed Mordecai’s decree, they had new courage and were not afraid of the enemy, and their courage put fear into the hearts of the enemy.” Esther’s own actions state her confidence in God’s outworking in her world. Perhaps she is remembering verses from Psalm 22: “(29) All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you. (28) For kingship belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations.” Book of Esther: A Hard Victory and a Profound Remembrance. Haman and Xerxes’ first edict and the second correcting edict allowing the Jews to gather and defend themselves have resulted in a small scale war. Verse 16 of chapter 9 tells us that at the end of the fighting across the 127 provinces the Jews have killed 75,000 Persians in defending themselves. This does not count wounded or captured or calculate the number of Jews killed and wounded. This casualty level states a much larger number of Persians who joined in the attack against the Jews. It means that the Jews, in defending themselves, and even in having the help of the king’s administration, may still have been outnumbered in many instances. They fought across a vast territory and amidst a large foreign population mostly ambivalent and probably often unwilling to assist them. To frame this, Guinness world records says that 49 million of the world’s estimated 112 million people lived in the Persian Empire in 480 BC. Keep in mind that God does not deliver the Jews from conflict, but does enable them to enter the conflict and overcome. Verses 15 and 16 also tells us that the Jews in Susa, and the Jews in the 127 provinces, did not take any plunder from those they defeated. To not take the property of the defeated was to behave differently than every other people, nation, or culture at this time in history. Plunder was the accepted right of the victor, and a sensible practice at a time when resources were scarce and survival from year to year was a high risk proposition. Under the second edict the Jews were granted the right to take the property of those who attacked them. Question: What does this refusal to take plunder tell us? This is affirmative proof that the Jews had not forgotten God; and that the Book of Esther does not simply offer a recounting of secular events. It is very similar to Abraham’s decision to not take plunder after defeating Kedorlaomer and three other kings in rescuing Lot. In Genesis 14:22 Abram said, “I have raised my hand to the LORD. God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, and have taken an oath that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or a thong of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’” After this fearless testimony, God comes to Abram in a vision, in Genesis 15:1, and says, “Don’t be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, and your great reward.” So, by their actions rather than spoken words, the Jews were announcing to everyone around them that they looked to God and acknowledged him as the source of their deliverance and provision. They were expressing their confidence, that even in exile, God was with them and had not abandoned them. This decisive act of faith must have spooked the Persians. It affirmed God’s view that this was a holy war, and not a regional conflict. It had further symbolism in correcting Saul’s error, long before the reign of Xerxes and the time of exile, in keeping plunder from the Amalekites when God told him not to. Following this conflict, and their deliverance the Jews paused and celebrated. In rural villages the conflict ended sooner than in the cities so the celebrations crossed over several days. What is interesting is that the Jews celebrated on their own. This was not commanded by God but was very much in keeping with his character in remembering and celebrating great moments of God’s faithfulness such as Passover. Mordecai observed this celebration and then formalized it in verses 20-22, with a letter sent to all the provinces, directing that all Jews celebrate this occasion each year, on the 14th and 15th day of Adar. This celebration became Purim, meaning ‘lot’ referencing Haman’s roll of the dice in Esther 3:7 to determine the day, month, and year in which the Jews were to be massacred. Verse 29 tells us that Esther and Mordecai, together, write, with full authority, a second letter, confirming that Purim would always be celebrated as Mordecai directed in the first letter. This letter is described in verse 30 as “words of peace and truth. Question: What is the significance of Purim and what do we, as followers of Christ, learn from the Book of Esther? God uses the common, the ordinary, the imperfect, the dispossessed, the exiled, the weak, the poor, the endangered, the beleaguered, and the oppressed to accomplish his great and majestic purposes. This cannot be emphasized too strongly or repeated too often. Esther had great beauty and Mordecai was a low level court official but they did not have wealth, preference, or distinction in the Persian Empire.

For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.” We must join Esther and Mordecai in looking up to God. Reach out to him when you are at lowest ebb. He will take hold and not let go. God enters history, he enters our daily lives, he enters into places that we view as dark and forbidden, nothing withstands him. The term ‘Purim’ really tells us that God’s power, and providential care for his people are greater than Haman’s power and greater than his cold casting of the dice. In Isaiah 45 God says “I am the LORD, and there is no other. I form the light and create darkness; I bring prosperity and create disaster. I, the LORD, do all these things” During the Holocaust Jews took great care to preserve and share the text of Esther; and to remember God’s actions in saving his people from extinction.

Mordecai observed this celebration and then formalized it in verses 20-22, with a letter sent to all the provinces, directing that all Jews celebrate this occasion each year, on the 14th and 15th day of Adar. This celebration became Purim, meaning ‘lot’ referencing Haman’s roll of the dice in Esther 3:7 to determine the day, month, and year in which the Jews were to be massacred. Question: What do we as the church of Christ celebrate and should we be better at remembering the extraordinary moments in our history? And what would they be? Verse 29 tells us that Esther and Mordecai, together, write, with full authority, a second letter, confirming that Purim would always be celebrated as Mordecai directed in the first letter. This letter is described in verse 30 as “words of peace and truth. Question: What is the significance of Purim and what do we, as followers of Christ, learn from the Book of Esther? God uses the common, the ordinary, the imperfect, the dispossessed, the exiled, the weak, the poor, the endangered, the beleaguered, and the oppressed to accomplish his great and majestic purposes. This cannot be emphasized too strongly or repeated too often. Esther had great beauty and Mordecai was a low level court official but they did not have wealth, preference, or distinction in the Persian Empire. They were exiles, with no rights, subject to the rule of a vast empire. God uses this approach so often because the weak have no delusions about where deliverance and salvation come from. Think of Mordecai’s raw lament and unembarrassed display of weeping, sack cloth, and ashes. If we saw him coming down the street we would cross to the other side. David, even when he was king, knew about God’s love and great compassion for our weakness and infirmity. In Psalm 61 he wrote, “Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer. From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I. For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.” We must join Esther and Mordecai in looking up to God. Reach out to him when you are at lowest ebb. He will take hold and not let go. God enters history, he enters our daily lives, he enters into places that we view as dark and forbidden; nothing withstands him. The term ‘Purim’ really tells us that God’s power, and providential care for his people, are greater than Haman’s power and greater than his cold casting of the dice. In Isaiah 45 God says “I am the LORD, and there is no other. I form the light and create darkness; I bring prosperity and create disaster. I, the LORD, do all these things” During the Holocaust Jews took great care to preserve and share the text of Esther; and to remember God’s actions in saving his people from extinction. Even when our primary experience and feeling leads us to despair and mourning before God; God is present and at work. Even when loss gives way to greater loss, God’s presiding is greater. Jewish tradition says that King David composed Psalm 22 with Esther in his prophetic view, and that Esther repeated Psalm 22 over and over during her time of trial. Psalm 22 is a powerful lament, and begins with haunting words, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from the words of my groaning? Oh my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent.” The rejoicing of Purim is on the other side of this wrenching lament. And the memory of Purim becomes the small flame in the vast darkness of the Holocaust. In the same way the celebration of the greatness of Mordecai in chapter 10 is founded on the sack cloth and ashes that Mordecai wore in chapter 4. God is not interested in elevating the powerful and the sleekly successful; he seeks the broken and poor in spirit to accomplish his greatest works; those who cannot take one step without reaching out to God for steadying help. Women stand equally with men before God and Christ; and God uses them powerfully in leading and accomplishing his work. God elevates Esther to a position of power and uses her to accomplish his greater purpose by making her a superlative, if flawed leader. By the end of chapter 9 Esther is called Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, signifying that God has brought her to full maturity as both queen of Persia and queen of her people, the chosen people of God. She served God with courage, fierce persistence, humility, and wisdom greater than her soul; because she chose to trust God, and follow him rather than giving counsel to her fears. She kept God’s instruction in Isaiah 41:10, “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.” Faith begins with each individual but is grounded in the community of believers in Christ, which today is the Church. Esther and Mordecai worked together to address the challenges they faced. They didn’t abandon one another, resent one another, or betray one another. Esther put Mordecai forward at risk to her own reputation, and Mordecai was steadfast in putting his people first, and not seeking his own preferment. Mordecai also kept Esther informed when she had no other sources of outside information and reminded her of God’s greater purposes for her at the critical moment. Finally Esther reminds us that even when everything around us seems to degrade, devalue, mock, and override our very faith, and the very presence of God, He is still there, and we are his chosen people; inhabited by his divine majesty, mercy, wisdom, power, love, and grace. We may travel dark paths in the world but we are set apart as his children of light. As Peter wrote in I Peter 2:9 “But you are a chosen people a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” This is our identity in life and in death; and in the great eternal life to come. So the end is not the end. The deliverance for the Jews occurred in 473 B.C. and Xerxes reign continued until August 465 B.C., eight years later, when Xerxes and his son Darius were assassinated by Artabanus, the leader of the king’s body guard, with the help of a eunuch named Aspamitres. Artaxerxes, the third son of Xerxes, seized power by killing Artabanus, and became the next king. In the Book of Ezra, Artaxerxes commissions Ezra, to take charge of Israel. Ezra returns to Israel in the seventh year of Artaxerxes’ reign. In the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign, Nehemiah is commissioned to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls of the city. We don’t know the rest of Esther’s fate or journey. Some say that she was the mother of Darius II who became king after Artaxerxes. Some say that Esther is the queen mentioned in Nehemiah 2:6, sitting beside Artaxerxes in the 20th year of his reign; when he commissions Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem. Some say she died when she was still young and others that she lived to an old age. We don’t know. What we do know is that her life did not end with Purim, nor did it become easy or idyllic. God did not deliver her from challenge, or the fantastic corruption of the Persian Empire; but he did walk with her in all her trials, he did give her a life of extraordinary significance, even if she could not see it completely at the time, he did give her an identity that aligned with His own character, enabling her to act in ways beyond her capacity, and he did give her a profound cause to rejoice, so great that it endures to this day. Today, with the same power, love, majesty, mercy, and conviction, He reaches out to us. How will we respond?"
